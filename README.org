* Overview
 
This class implements a LaTeX port of the [[https://github.com/aerohub/hugo-orbit-theme][Hugo Orbit]] theme by [[https://github.com/aerohub][Pavel Kanyshev]].
The implementation was loosely inspired by [[https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine][Carmine Spagnuolo's]]
[[https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex][TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae]] class. Unlike TwentySecondsCV, ~orbit-cv~ does not
impose a one-page limit, and it works as expected with longer résumés / CVs.

I tried to maintain the look and feel of the Orbit theme as much as possible,
and the six color schemes implemented by it are available. 

* Usage

** Requirements
   This class assumes a more or less current and full LiveTeX installation, and
   does not require any additional packages if you have one. The typography is
   based on the the [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto][Roboto fonts]], so you should install those.

   Otherwise, the only thing required is a small-ish picture in a square-ish
   crop.
** Getting Started

  An example résumé is provided along with the class, and can be found in the
  [[./orbit-cv.tex]] file. Below you will find an explanation of the commands
  available.
*** Options
    The ~leftSidebar~ option can be passed to this class to render the sidebar
    on the left side of the page, as opposed to the right side, which is the default.

*** Basic personal data
    You should provide at least your name, your job description / title, and a
    profile picture. This can be done with the same commands as in
    TwentySecondsCV:

#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\cvname{Rusty Statue} %your name
\cvjobtitle{Garden Statue}%your actual job position
\profilepic{rusty.png} %path of profile pic
#+END_SRC
    Your contact information can be added with the ~\addContact~ macro, which
    expects two parameters. The first argument is meant to be an icon, and the
    second one should be some contact information, such as email, website URL,
    github profile, etc. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\addContact{\faEnvelope{}}{\href{mailto:rusty@example.com}{rusty@example.com}}
\addContact{\faPhone{}}{+1234567890}
\addContact{\faGlobe{}}{\href{http://rusty.example.com}{http://rusty.example.com}}
#+END_SRC

    The contact information will be typeset as a table in the sidebar.

   You can also add information about your education with the ~\addEducation~
   macro, which takes three parameters: degree, school, and time period. For
   example:
   
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\addEducation{PhD. in Hanging Gardening}{Babylon University}{2002—2005}
#+END_SRC

   Language information can be added with the ~\addLanguage~ macro, as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\addLanguage{Spanish}{native}
\addLanguage{English}{professional}
\addLanguage{French}{professional}
#+END_SRC

   The first argument in each call should be a language, and the second one a
   level of proficiency.

   If you want to add hobbies or interests, it should be done with the
   ~\addInterest~ macro, which takes a single parameter. For instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\addInterest{\faCutlery{} Cooking}
\addInterest{\faCamera{} Photography}
#+END_SRC

*** Building the Sidebar

  Once you have entered your profile information, you should invoke the
  ~\makeprofile~ macro, which will handle the building of the sidebar.

*** Main Sections and Helper Macros
  
    You can then proceed to add the main content of your résumé or CV, namely
    something about your career, experience, projects, etc.
    The class provides a few macros to help you format those items in a
    consistent manner. 
    The ~\workexp~ macro allows you to add an item of work experience. It takes
    four parameters, namely a title, a time period, a company name, and a
    description of the work done / achievements, etc. A usage example could be:

#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\workexp{Senior Scarecrow}{2017 — present}{The Hanging Garden, Inc.}{
As a Senior Scarecrow at the Hanging Garden, I took care of scaring off all the 
birds and other vermin that came around. I did this so well, that I won
the coveted ``scarecrow of the month'' award.
}
#+END_SRC


   The ~\project~ macro takes three paramters: an URL, a project title, and a
   description. As of this version the URL is not optional, so if one is not
   available for the project, it could be made to point to the output pdf
   itself, or some such.

#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\project{https://www.example.com/blueGarden}{The Blue Garden}{
In the ``Blue Garden'' project, I took care of delivering all the blue fruits and 
seeds, as well as implementing the irrigation plan.
}
#+END_SRC

   If you have publications, you can use the ~\publication~ macro, which takes
   three parameters: a name, an author list, and a venue. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\publication{Fair Gardening}{R. Statue et al.}{IEEE Gardening Letters, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 184-187. Jan. 2017}
#+END_SRC

   At some point I may implement BibTeX compatibility for this, but for now this
   will have to do.

*** Skills
    If you want to present skills in an ``infographic-like'' manner, you can use
    the ~\addSkill~ and ~\ListSkills~ macros. The first takes two parameters, a
    skill name and a skill level, the latter being a number between 0 and 1.
    Once the desired skills have been added, the ~\ListSkills~ macro can be
    called to render the list of skills (this is done in a tabular environment,
    so it may have issues if it overlaps a page break).

#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
\addSkill{\LaTeX}{0.95}
\addSkill{Scaring Crows}{0.85}
\addSkill{Gardening}{0.92}
\addSkill{Standing Still}{0.99}
\ListSkills{}
#+END_SRC

*** Color Schemes

  The =orbit-cv= class includes six color schemes, like those provided by the
  =Orbit= theme. The first scheme is the default, and the others can be accessed
  via one of the following macros (uncomment as needed)
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX :exports code
% Uncomment one of these if you'd rather
% not use the default color scheme

%\colorschemeTwo
%\colorschemeThree
%\colorschemeFour
%\colorschemeFive
%\colorschemeSix
#+END_SRC

The resulting outputs can be seen below.
